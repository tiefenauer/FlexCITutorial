<h1>Flexcover: A Code Coverage Tool for Flex and AS3</h1>
<p>Version 0.81</p>
<p><b>Joe Berkovitz (Noteflight, LLC) and Alex Uhlmann (Adobe Consulting)<br>
</b></p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to Flexcover, a tool that measures how much of your Flex,
AIR or AS3 application code actually runs when tested.  This document
offers some general information about Flexcover, explains how to
install it, and then walks through a quick tour of its features.  A
concluding reference section describes the command options, file
formats and APIs.</p>

<p>New features introduced since Flexcover 0.50 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Flex 3.2 SDK and Flex Builder 3.0.2</li>
  <li>Ability to interactively filter view by classes whose name matches a substring</li>
  <li>More efficient processing of coverage data within viewer</li>
  <li>Much faster sending of coverage data from instrumented application and viewer</li>
  <li>Ability to combine data from multiple test run reports</li>
  <li>Support for the instrumentation of top-level global functions</li>
</ul>

           
<h2>General information</h2>

<p>Flexcover is a code coverage tool for Flex, AIR and AS3.  It
incorporates a set of modifications to the Flex SDK, including both a
custom version of the mxmlc/compc compiler and custom framework
libraries.  The custom compiler inserts extra function calls in the
code within the SWF or SWC output file.  Code produced in this fashion
is called <b>instrumented code</b>, because the additional function
calls act like a measuring instrument: Flexcover measures which lines
and conditional branches in the application have executed, and how
many times.</p>

<p>At runtime, these function calls send information on the
application's code coverage to an object called a <b>coverage
agent</b>, that is responsible for summarizing and recording the
coverage data.  The default coverage agent sends this data out using a
LocalConnection.  The modified compiler also emits a separate
<b>coverage metadata</b> file that describes all the possible
packages, classes, functions, lines and conditional branches in the
code, as well as the names of the associated source code files.  The
metadata is essential for measuring coverage, because it is the only
source of information on code that has <u>not</u> executed.</p>

<p>The companion to this modified compiler is an AIR application called
<b>CoverageViewer</b>.  CoverageViewer listens on the LocalConnection used by the
default coverage agent, and works with the coverage data that is
transmitted from instrumented applications that are running at the same time.</p>

<p>After coverage data has been collected by CoverageViewer, it can be saved as a
<b>coverage report</b>, which is an XML file describing all the
elements in the program which could conceivably be executed, and their
coverage statistics.</p>

<p>Here's a block diagram that shows how the different components and
file types used by Flexcover relate to each other:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/coverage-architecture.png"/></p>

<p>CoverageViewer is the application through which one interacts with the Flexcover system when testing.  It's more than just a viewer; it does the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load coverage metadata files that describe the codebase whose coverage will be measured.</li>

<li>View live code coverage statistics while an instrumented application is run.
  Data from multiple test runs may be accumulated.</li>

<li>View application source code annotated with code coverage information for lines
and conditional branches.</li>

<li>Save accumulated statistics in an XML report.</li>

<li>Load a previously written report and view its contents, or record more data
from live runs against the code described in the report.</li>

<li>Automatically write a report and quit when a test suite indicates
  that testing has concluded.</li>

</ul>

<p>Flexcover's modified compilers accept special command line options
that control its behavior.  By default, however, a Flex SDK modified by
Flexcover will instrument every application that is built with it,
since this provides the most convenient behavior for many developers and
eliminates the need for changes to one's build process.</p>

<p>In this way, instrumented applications may be built by simply
configuring your project's current development tools to use the custom
Flexcover SDK.  No compiler switches or options are needed, and you
can use whatever tools you like to build your instrumented
applications, including Flex Builder.</p>

</pre>


<h2>Installing Flexcover</h2>

<h3>1. Create a copy of the Flex SDK that you will customize for Flexcover</h3>

<p>Flexcover uses a customized version of the Flex compiler and also
requires a special Flex framework library.  To use flexcover you must
first create a version of the Flex 3 SDK that has been modified to
include these components.  (It would be simpler if Flexcover could
include a complete SDK that was already modified, but that file would
be too large to be hosted on Google Code as a download.)  Once you
have created this modified SDK, you can freely copy the SDK to other
machines without repeating the initial creation process.</p>

<p>To create the modified SDK, unzip a copy of the Flex 3.0 or Flex 3.2 SDKs into a
directory on your computer that is separate from any existing Flex SDK
installation you might have.  For simplicity and predictability, we
recommend that you download either <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/download?build=3.2.0.3794&pkgtype=1">Adobe
Flex SDK 3.2.0.3794</a> or  <a
href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/download?build=3.0.1.1092&pkgtype=1">Adobe
Flex SDK 3.0.1.1092</a> with this version of Flexcover, because these
are the exact Flex SDK versions that the Flexcover modifications are
based on.</p> Howvever, you may use other SDKs if you wish.  Other
Flex 3 SDK distributions are available from the <a
href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+3">Flex
3 SDK Downloads</a> page, or you can modify a copy of some particular
Flex 3 SDK version that you already have on hand (including the one
that comes with Flex Builder 3).

<p>For clarity, it's a very good idea to give this SDK directory a
descriptive name, for example <tt>flexcover-sdk-3.0</tt>.

<h3>2. Modify this custom SDK to use the Flexcover compilers and libraries.</h3>

<p>The flexcover distribution contains directories named
<tt>sdk-modifications-3_0</tt> and <tt>sdk-modifications-3_2</tt>.
Choose the appropriate directory based on the Flex SDK you are using,
and copy its contents into the root directory of the special Flex SDK
that you created in the previous step.</p>

<p>Make sure that you are copying <tt>sdk-modifications-3_x/lib</tt>,
<tt>sdk-modifications-3_x/frameworks</tt>, etc. directly on top of the
corresponding subdirectories in the SDK that are named <tt>lib</tt>,
<tt>frameworks</tt>, and so on.  Do not make the mistake of copying
the <tt>sdk-modifications-3_x</tt> directory itself into the SDK.  The
files in the sdk-modifications-3_x/ directory are supposed to overwrite
the corresponding ones in the destination SDK; that's intentional!  In
a typical OS desktop such as Windows Explorer or the MacOS Finder, you
should open windows for both directories, then drag all items in the
sdk-modifications window and drop them into the window for the
destination SDK.</p>

<h3>3. Modify your own build tools to use the custom Flexcover SDK</h3>

<p>When you want to make use of Flexcover to build your applications
with coverage instrumentation, you will need to change your build
process to use the custom Flexcover SDK that you just created.  Doing
so will automatically generate instrumented AS3 bytecode, whether you
are using compc (building library projects) or mxmlc (building
application projects).</p>

<p>No matter what your build approach, you don't need to change the
compiler arguments: coverage instrumentation will be on by default whenever
the Flexcover SDK is used, and a coverage metadata file will automatically
be created alongside your output SWC or SWF file.
</p>

<p><b>Modifying Flex Builder</b>.  If you are using Flex Builder,
making this change is easy.  First add your custom Flexcover SDK to
Flex Builder using the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Preferences dialog, go to Flex / Installed Flex SDKs.</li>
<li>Click the Add... button.  A dialog will appear: Add Flex SDK.</li>
<li>Use the Browse button to select the Flexcover custom SDK directory that you just created.</li>
<li>Supply a name for the selected SDK, e.g. "Flexcover SDK 3.0".</li>
<li>Click OK in the Add Flex SDK dialog.</li>
<li>Click Apply in the Preferences panel (this is easy to forget!).</li>
</ol>

<p>The result should look similar to this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/flex-builder-sdk-configuration.png"/></p>

<p>Now, whenever you want to use Flexcover to build a Flex Builder
project, simply go into that project's Properties, and select Flex
Compiler on the left.  On the right, you will see an area labeled Flex
SDK Version.  Click the radio button labeled "Use a specific SDK", and select
your custom SDK from the dropdown list: </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/flex-builder-sdk-choice.png"/></p>

<p>With FlexBuilder 3.0.2, you can make use of the -coverage=false and
-coverage=true flags in the Project Preferences / Flex Compiler
options to turn code coverage instrumentation on and off for specific
projects.</p>

<p><b>Modifying Ant Builds</b>.  You will probably need to selectively
override a property definition such as <tt>FLEX_HOME</tt> that points to the
SDK to be used.  This can be done on the command line if desired, as in:</p>

<pre>
ant -DFLEX_HOME=c:/sdks/flexcover-sdk-3.0
</pre>

<h3>4. Install the CoverageViewer AIR Application</h3>

<p>Install the <tt>CoverageViewer.air</tt> application that is part of
the Flexcover distribution, and go through the AIR installation
process.  You may need to first install the AIR runtime in order to do
so -- this is readily available from Adobe's website.</p>


<h2>A quick tour of Flexcover</h2>

<p>If you've gotten this far, you're ready to try things out by
monitoring the code coverage of the sample <tt>CoverageExample1</tt>
application.


<h3>What's in CoverageExample1</h3>

<p>CoverageExample1 has already been compiled with a custom Flexcover SDK;
you don't have to rebuild it (although you can if you want to!).
Looking in the <tt>CoverageExample1/bin/</tt> subdirectory, you
will find the following files:</p>

<ul>
<p><b>The compiled application.</b> <tt>CoverageExample1.swf</tt>
is, of course, the sample application itself, compiled by the
custom Flexcover SDK so that its code is instrumented to measure and
transmit coverage data.</p>

<p><b>Its coverage metadata.</b> <tt>CoverageExample1.cvm</tt> is a
"coverage metadata" file that is used to determine what executable
lines actually exist in the source code, as a basis for coverage
calculations.  If you peek inside this file, you'll see it's a text
file; each line describes one executable line or conditional branch in
the program.</p> </ul>

<h3>Start up the Coverage Viewer on CoverageExample1.cvm</h3>

<p>As a first step, start up CoverageViewer so that it will load the
CVM file and report on coverage statistics for the sample application.
You can do this in any of the following ways:</p>

<ul>

<li>On your computer's desktop, open the file
<tt>CoverageExample1.cvm</tt>.  This should launch
the CoverageViewer on the metadata for the sample application (since CoverageViewer
registers itself for the CVM file type).</li>

<li>Launch the Coverage Viewer application independently, then drag the file
<tt>CoverageExample1.cvm</tt> on top of the viewer window and drop it there.</li>

<li>Launch the Coverage Viewer, then click the <b>Load File...</b>
button; in the resulting dialog, locate the <tt>CoverageExample1.cvm</tt> file and
click <b>Open</b>.</li>

</ul>

<p>After launching the CoverageViewer AIR
application on the coverage metadata for CoverageExample1, you'll see something
like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/initial-coverage-view.png"/></p>

<p>All the data will reflect zero coverage, which is hardly surprising
since the application hasn't started yet!</p>

<h3>Start the CoverageExample1 Application</h3>

<p>Leaving the CoverageViewer running, open the
<tt>CoverageExample1.swf</tt> file in the Flash Player to run the
application.  You should see something like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/example1-app.png"/></p>

<p>At this point, you may want to quickly browse the source of the
application in the <tt>src/</tt> directory -- there's not very much to
this example!</p>

<h3>Exploring coverage data with the CoverageViewer</h3>

<p>Now go back to the CoverageViewer window.  You will already see a
change in the statistics, since starting up the instrumented
application will have caused some code to execute.  This is a good
time to start to explore the features of the Coverage Viewer.</p>

<p><b>Branch and Line coverage tabs</b>.  The main view is tabbed to
allow the examination of either branch or line coverage statistics.</p>

<p>By default the display shows branch coverage.  Each of the following are
considered a single "branch", and are counted as covered if they occur one
or more times:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entry into a function body</li>
<li>Evaluation of a conditional expression as <tt>true</tt></li>
<li>Evaluation of a conditional expression as <tt>false</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Line coverage is simpler: a line of the program is considered
to have been covered if any portion of it runs at least once.</p>

<p><b>Drill-down coverage statistics</b>.  Each line of the main view
is an expandable row describing (in hierarchical order) the coverage for:</p>

<ul>
<li>the entire application
<li>a package within the application (these are not broken out hierarchically)
<li>a class
<li>a single function
</ul>

<p>If you drill down on every element of the example application at this point,
you'll see something like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/drill-down-coverage.png"/></p>

<p>At this point we're looking at all the packages, classes and
functions in this simple application.  Some functions have names like
<tt>testFunction</tt> in <tt>pkg.TestClass</tt>; these are
ActionScript functions.  Other functions have names like
<tt>___TestPanel_Button1_click</tt>.  These are functions that
correspond to event scripts in MXML components.</p>

<p>The <b>data columns</b> in this table include: </p>
<ul>

<li><b>Branch or Line Coverage</b>: the percentage of code that has been
executed in this section of the application.  A colored bar in these
cells will change from red through a red/green combination to entirely
green as the coverage ratio ranges from 0% to 100%.</li>

<li><b>Uncovered</b>: the number of branches or lines in the application that
have not yet been recorded as executed.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can sort the display on any of these columns by clicking in the
area to the right of each column label to select an ascending or descending sort.
Sorting by uncovered elements is a particularly handy way to focus on the least-covered
portions of an application.</p>

<p>Go back to the sample application window and click each button
exactly once.  You'll see the data change in a live fashion, and the
display may now look like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/drill-down-coverage2.png"/></p>

<p>We can see that a lot of code has run as a result of our "test",
but that some didn't.  Which bits didn't run?  To explore that
question, we'll want to use the source-viewing features of the
CoverageViewer.</p>


<h3>Exploring coverage data within the source code</h3>

<p><b>Source Viewer</b> shows the source code for a class, annotated
with branch and line coverage information.  Let's look at the source
for <tt>pkg.TestClass</tt>: click in the table cell marked
<b>testFunction</b>, which we can see did not get full coverage.  We'll
now get a split screen display like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/source-viewer-initial.png"/></p>

<p>Let's look at the various elements of the source display:</p>

<p><b>Line numbers</b> are shown for each line of source, on the left.</p>

<p><b>Line execution counts</b> show how many times each source line
has been executed; they are displayed to the right of each line
number.  These execution counts are highlighted green if the line
<u>and any branches within it</u> have been covered.  A red highlight
indicates that either the line itself has not executed (as in line 18
above), or that one or more branches within the line have not executed
(as in line 16 above).</p>

<p><b>Branch execution counts</b> are shown within each line as small
superscript numbers showing <b>branch execution counts</b> These show
how many times a branch condition has been evaluated as true (with a
"+" symbol) or false (with a "-").  For example, the branch count on
line 13 shows that testFunction() has run exactly once (it's shown as
a + because there is no false condition for entering a function; it's
not a conditional).  The branch count on line 16 is shown as -0+1,
indicating that the <tt>if</tt> statement has encountered a true
condition zero times (causing it to be uncovered and highlighted red)
and a false condition one time (highlighted green)</p>

<p>The <b>coverage gap locator</b> is the area to the right of the scroll bar;
it shows where in the source coverage gaps occur.  This is very handy in large
source files.</p>

<p>Analyzing the above situation, we can see that line 16 isn't going to 
encounter a true condition until the value of <tt>counter</tt> reaches
5.  Go back to the example application and continue clicking the button
that calls testFunction().  The display will update, eventually reaching
this state:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/source-viewer-more-coverage.png"/></p>

<p>The app still isn't at 100% yet, though!  As an exercise, see if
you can get the application's coverage to 100% by using the source
viewer and identifying what code hasn't been covered yet.  Note that
MXML source files also have code coverage, not just ActionScript
sources: the first line of an MXML component counts as "covered" when
the component is created, and event scripts on components are
considered as functions.  And, of course, any
<tt>&lt;mx:Script&gt;</tt> blocks will be analyzed as if they were
ActionScript.</p>

<p>For better performance, coverage data is buffered in memory and is
only transmitted to the Coverage Viewer at 1-second intervals. You
will notice a short delay between actions in the application and
updates in the viewer.</p>

<h3>Saving and viewing code coverage reports</h3>

<p>Click the <b>Save Report...</b> button at the top of the coverage
viewer's main window.  You will be offered a dialog permitting you to
save a coverage report.  Save this file with a <tt>.cvr</tt> suffix
and take a look at it -- you will see that it incorporates all the
information in the drill-down coverage table.  Such a report can be
formatted or otherwise rearranged with XSL stylesheets.These saved
files can also be reloaded by the Coverage Viewer to view a report.

<p>To load a saved coverage report, use the <b>Load File...</b> button
or simply drop the coverage report file into the application.</p>

<h3>Build CoverageExample1 yourself (requires Flex Builder)</h3>

<p>Delete the contents of the CoverageExample1/bin directory, then
import CoverageExample1 as a Flex Builder project.  Remember to change
the Flex Compiler for the project to your custom Flexcover SDK!  Now
build the application.  You will see both a .swf and a .cvm file appear
in the project's bin/ directory after building the project.</p>

<p>The best way to launch CoverageViewer on a Flex Builder project is as follows:

<ol>

<li><b>Always clean your project</b> before building with coverage
instrumentation!.  Flex builder uses so-called "incremental
compilation" in which it only recompiles changed files; this can throw
off the contents of the .cvm files which will only contain metadata
for the recompiled files.</li>

<li><b>Build your project</b> using the Build Project command, so that it doesn't
run right away after being built.</li>

<li><b>Double click one or more .cvm files</b> to launch the CoverageViewer
with the proper set of metadata.</li>

<li>Now <b>start up your project's application</b>, which will have been instrumented.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Additional Topics and Information</h2>

<h3>More about Branch Coverage</h3>

<p>The following are considered to be "conditional expressions" for branch-counting purposes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Boolean conditions tested by a control-flow statement (if, while,
do...while, for) </li>

<li>Boolean conditions tested by a conditional operator (?:)</li>

<li>Case labels in a switch statement are considered true iff the
switch value matches the label value.</li>

<li>Boolean conditions tested by a || or &amp;&amp; operator.</li>

</ul>

<p>Branch counts are shown in strange places within the source,
sometimes.  The AS3 compiler was not designed to report column numbers
for conditional expressions in an intuitive way, so the counts usually show up
just to the right of a relational operator like ==, &lt;, and so on.</p>

<p>Also, there are special limitations on the display of branch
coverage for MXML files, because the compiler doesn't provide any useful
column number information at all in this case.  MXML files will always show branches
for each line "piled up" at the end of the line.</p>

<p>Finally, branch counts for complex Boolean conditions tested by a
|| or &amp;&amp; operator are a little odd and tricky to interpret.
At the moment, this problem is difficult to address given the
existing structure of the compiler.  Here are some basic hints at
understanding how these work:</p>

<ul>

<li>The branch count for || or &amp;&amp; is always shown next to the
preceding relational operator on the <u>left hand side</u>. In such
counts, "+" means that the preceding condition was <i>false</i>.  In a
branch count for &amp;&amp;, "+" means that the preceding condition
was <i>true</i>.</li>

<li>The branch count on the <u>right hand side</u> of || or &amp;&amp;
describes the branch count for the <u>result of the compound
expression</u>, not just the right-hand condition as you might
expect.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Sorting the display</h3>

<p>Coverage entries in the table are displayed alphabetically by
default, but clicking in the table headers permits the sort order to be changed.
A particularly useful option is to sort by ascending code coverage, which allows
one to methodically work through the areas with the worst coverage first and
identify testing deficits.</p>

<h3>Filtering the display</h3>

<p>Type a search string in the Search field, and coverage entries in
the table will be automatically filtered to include only matching
classes.  This is very convenient for focusing on parts of large projects.</p>

<h3>Controlling UI updates</h3>

<p>The "Update" button forces the UI to immediately process all
received coverage data.  The accompanying checkbox labeled "Auto"
controls whether received coverage data is automatically reflected in
the UI.  Applications that generate a large amount of coverage
information may lose their data connection if "Auto" remains checked,
because the viewer becomes too busy processing the data it has already
received to keep up with newly arrived data.  For interactive coverage
measurement of such applications, it is best to uncheck "Auto" and
manually click "Update" when the view should be refreshed.</p>

<h3>Working with Large Projects</h3>

<p>If your project has many subprojects, or you are using libraries
and Flex Modules, you may be building multiple SWCs and SWFs.  Each of
these files can have its own coverage metadata (CVM) file generated
when the SWC or SWF was built.  If you want to collect data on all of
code contained in these files, you will have to load all of the CVM
files into the CoverageViewer before running the instrumented
application.</p>

<p>It's perfectly fine to load as many CVM files into the
CoverageViewer as you like.  Once you have done so, you will be
working with the merged metadata from all the reports.  In fact, if
you save a coverage report at this point as a .cvr file, you will save
the merged metadata (even though no coverage data has been collected
yet) and can later reload it and work with it again instead of having
to bring in the individual CVM files.  However, note that if you work
with old metadata and are running a later version of the application,
your coverage numbers will be meaningless.</p>

<p>Additionally, CVM files are just line-oriented text files.  You can
concatenate them together into a single file using shell scripts, if
that's convenient.</p>

<p>Coverage Reports are in fact a superset of coverage metadata --
they are the union of metadata with recorded coverage information.
You can save a coverage report with or without data in it, and later
restart the viewer, load the report, and run the application again with
different tests to add more data to the report, then save a new copy of the
report.</p>

<h3>Working with Automated Unit Test Suites</h3>

<p>If you want to measure coverage data as part of an unattended
automated test suite, you will need to optionally modify your suite to
call <tt>CoverageManager.exit()</tt> (see reference section below)
before the test suite exits.  Before running your suite, you'll want
to start Coverage Viewer with the <tt>-output</tt> option to specify the
.cvr report file to which the report will be written after the test suite
concludes.</p>

<h2>Reference Information</h2>

<p>This section provides reference information on various aspects of
Flexcover.  It's somewhat incomplete right now, but at least you've
got the source code.</p>

<h3>Coverage compiler reference</h3>

<p>The following special compiler options are supported by the
modified Flexcover SDK's <tt>mxmlc</tt> and <tt>compc</tt> commands:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt>-coverage</tt></td>
<td valign="top">Indicates that coverage instrumentation is to be placed into the generated bytecode of the SWF or SWC.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt>-coverage=false</tt></td>
<td valign="top">Since coverage is turned on by default, this option is what you need to turn it off.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt>-coverage-metadata=<i>metadata-filename.cvm</i></tt></td>
<td valign="top">The name of a coverage metadata file to be output for subsequent use in the Coverage Viewer.  This file will only contain actual data if the <tt>-coverage</tt> option is also given.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Compiler configuration files in the <tt>flex-config.xml</tt> format
may also contain the directive:

<pre>
&lt;coverage&gt;true&lt;/coverage&gt;
</pre>

<p>which has the same effect as the <tt>-coverage</tt> option.  The
default <tt>flex-config.xml</tt> and <tt>air-config.xml</tt> files in
the SDK enable coverage, because there is no other effective way to
turn it on when using the SDK in Flex Builder 3, due to a Flex Builder bug.</p>

<h3>Coverage Viewer command-line options</h3>

<p>One or more input files may be freely specified on the command
line.  They are distinguished solely by their extensions.

<p>Command line elements are as follows:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt>-output <i>report-filename.cvr</i></tt></td>
<td valign="top">The name of an CVR report file to be written immediately when the instrumented application calls <tt>CoverageManager.exit()</tt>.  The viewer will exit as soon as the report is written.</td>
</tr>

<h3>Coverage Manager API reference</h3>

<p>Instrumented applications may make explicit calls to the
<tt>com.allurent.coverage.runtime.CoverageManager</tt> class to
control various instrumentation options.  See the source code in
the <tt>CoverageAgent/src</tt> directory for more details.

<p>The <tt>CoverageManager</tt> class and the global function
<tt>coverage()</tt> are linked from the <tt>CoverageAgent.swc</tt> file in
the modified SDK.

<p>The <tt>ICoverageAgent</tt> interface allows developers to build
their own coverage agents, rather than relying on the built-in
LocalConnection based approach.  Thus, Flexcover supports multiple
approaches to recording and multiple data-collecting applications.
The AbstractCoverageAgent class provides basic support for recording,
independent of the means used to communicate coverage data to an
external application.


<h3>Automatically generating code coverage reports</h3>

<p>One of the most useful ways to work with code coverage information
is to automatically generate it as part of a continuous build process,
typically in conjunction with unit or integration test suites that
exercise the code.  The coverage information then becomes a metric
that indicates how successful the tests are at reaching all the code
that is under test.</p>

<p>An important aspect of generating code coverage information is for the
test application to cleanly exit, only after it has flushed all coverage
data through the coverage agent.  This can be accomplished by having the
test application call <tt>com.allurent.coverage.runtime.CoverageManager.exit()</tt>
which will flush all coverage data and then quit the program, also requesting
the CoverageViewer to write its report file and quit if it was given a
report filename on startup.</p>

<h3>Data format reference</h3>

<p><b>Coverage metadata (.cvm) files</b> are text files that contain a list of
<b>coverage elements</b>, one element per line.  Each coverage element
has this syntax:

<pre>
coverage-element ::=
    branch-element | line-element

branch-element ::=
    package ":" class "/" function "@" [ "+" | "-" ] line [ "." column ] [";" source-path]

line-element ::=
    package ":" class "/" function "@" line [";" source-path]
</pre>

<p>For instance take a look at this excerpt from CoverageExample1.cvm:

<pre>
pkg:TestClass/testFunction@13;C:\Source\flexcover\CoverageExample1\src\pkg\TestClass.as
pkg:TestClass/testFunction@+13.26
pkg:TestClass/testFunction@15
pkg:TestClass/testFunction@16
pkg:TestClass/testFunction@+16.31
pkg:TestClass/testFunction@-16.31
pkg:TestClass/testFunction@18
pkg:TestClass/testFunction@20
</pre>

<p>This data format is inefficient in some ways, but it compresses
well and is very easy to generate from within the modified compiler.</p>

<p><b>Coverage instrumentation data</b> transmitted over the
LocalConnection from the instrumented application invokes two handler
functions on the receiving end: <tt>coverageData(map:Object)</tt> and
<tt>coverageEnd()</tt>.  The coverageData function will be passed an
object whose keys are coverage elements and whose values are execution
counts.  The coverageEnd function is called if the instrumented
application has called CoverageManager.exit(), after all remaining
coverage data has been transmitted.</p>

<p><b>Coverage report (.cvr) files</b> are XML files that describe a hierarchy
of program elements and provide data at each level of the hierarchy, summarized
for non-leaf nodes.  Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
&lt;applicationCoverage name="[Application]"
        lineCoverage="0.9063" coveredLines="29" lines="32"
        branchCoverage="0.9167" coveredBranches="11" branches="12"&gt;
  &lt;package name="com.allurent"
          lineCoverage="0.9091" coveredLines="10" lines="11"
          branchCoverage="1.000" coveredBranches="3" branches="3"&gt;
    &lt;class name="CoverageTest"
             lineCoverage="0.9091" coveredLines="10" lines="11"
             branchCoverage="1.000" coveredBranches="3" branches="3"
             pathname="C:\Source\flexcover\CoverageTest\src\CoverageTest.mxml"&gt;
      &lt;function name="___CoverageTest_WindowedApplication1_applicationComplete"
             lineCoverage="1.000" coveredLines="1" lines="1"
             branchCoverage="1.000" coveredBranches="1" branches="1"&gt;
        &lt;branch name="+3#137.18" count="1"/&gt;
        &lt;line name="3" count="2"/&gt;
      &lt;/function&gt;
      &lt;function name="runTest"
             lineCoverage="0.8750" coveredLines="7" lines="8"
             branchCoverage="1.000" coveredBranches="1" branches="1"&gt;
        &lt;branch name="+12#119.27" count="1"/&gt;
        &lt;line name="12" count="1"/&gt;
        &lt;line name="14" count="1"/&gt;
        &lt;line name="15" count="1"/&gt;
        &lt;line name="16" count="1"/&gt;
        &lt;line name="17" count="1"/&gt;
        &lt;line name="18" count="1"/&gt;
        &lt;line name="19" count="1"/&gt;
        &lt;line name="20" count="0"/&gt;
      &lt;/function&gt;
    &lt;/class&gt;
  &lt;/package&gt;
&lt;/applicationCoverage&gt;

<h2>About the Flexcover SDK Modifications</h2>

<p>The Flexcover SDK modifications are maintained in a separate Google
Code project
called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flexcover-sdk/">flexcover-sdk</a>.
You can check them out in source form.  Understanding and building
these modifications requires in-depth knowledge of the Flex
ActionScript 3 compiler and associated development tools.</p>

<h2>Known issues and future development</h2>

<ul>

<li>It's desirable to allow instrumented AIR applications to write
coverage data directly to a file, to eliminate the inconvenience of
running the CoverageViewer in parallel.

<li>Although the compiler provides valuable information about the app
not available at runtime (particularly in the area of branch
coverage), it would be very convenient to instrument a SWF after it
had already compiled.  There are undocumented hooks in the Flash
Player which permit this, and we're looking into it.

<li>The internal architecture of the coverage viewer needs much more
work.

<li>The graphical bar renderers sometimes misbehave and persist on the screen.

<li>A clean integration with FlexUnit is highly desirable (e.g. run
test suites in AIR, flush coverage data to filesystem at end of run).
</ul>
